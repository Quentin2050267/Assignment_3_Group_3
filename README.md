# Assignment 3: Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) Implementation

During the class, we simulated OTC trading vs. exchange trading games. In the exchange trading game, all the orders submitted were matched using a central limit order book (CLOB). In this assignment, you will be required to implement a basic central limit order book (CLOB) for handling limit orders only. With the CLOB, you will simulate a simplified order book system where orders are matched based on price and time priority.

## Requirements and Evaluation (15%)

### Implementation
- Implement a central limit order book (CLOB) that only handles limit orders.
- Match incoming buy and sell orders according to price priority.
- Simulate the matching process and update the order book accordingly.
- Use the `orders.csv` provided for all the limit orders submitted.

### Load and describe the orders data (1%).

### The order book data should capture both buy and sell orders (2%).
- Buy orders should be sorted by descending price (highest bid first).
- Sell orders should be sorted by ascending price (lowest ask first).
- If two orders have the same price, the one that was placed earlier should have priority.

### Limit Order Matching
- When a new buy order is placed, it should be matched with the lowest-priced sell order if the sell price is less than or equal to the buy price (1%).
- When a new sell order is placed, it should be matched with the highest-priced buy order if the buy price is greater than or equal to the sell price (1%).
- If a full match is not possible, partially fill the order and leave the remaining quantity in the order book (1%).

### Order Book State
- After each order submission, print the updated order book showing the top buy and sell orders (1%).
- Implement a method to print the full order book for both bid and ask price levels with aggregated size for each level (2%).


### Trade Log
- Record the details of all trades matched with all the necessary information (2%).

### Spread and Market Depth
- **Bid-Ask Spread**
    - Calculate the bid-ask spread of the order book (1%).
- **Market Depth**
    - Calculate the dollar value of the average best level bid-ask market depth (1%).
- **Report and Documentation**
    - Report to describe the methodology and results (1%).
    - Documentation of code logic (1%).

- 23:59 hours, 26th Oct 2024.

## Submission Instructions
- Submit via Canvas by the deadline. Late submission will be penalized.
- Zip all files into one zip file with the naming format `Assignment_x_Group_x`. Group number should be the same as the project groups you are in on Canvas. No extra folder is needed inside the zip file.
- Python code should be executable and well documented. Both `.py` or `.ipynb` files are acceptable.
- Your report should document your methodology, analysis, and findings clearly and concisely, including all visualizations and statistical test results (if any).
